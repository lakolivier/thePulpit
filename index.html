            <p>Welcome to the website of inspiring pastor and thinker, Dr. Gil Bowen.</p> 
            <p>This site was created with help from members of previous congregations with Gil's blessing. Members who had saved DVDs of his sermons or programs with sermon summaries sent through the mail, contributed them. Gil also allowed his books and articles about him to be posted. 
            <p>The hope is that your spiritual life will be enriched by your time here thinking with Gil.</p>
